-- | <p>Compares a face in the <i>source</i> input image with each of the 100 largest faces detected in the <i>target</i> input image. </p> <note> <p> If the source image contains multiple faces, the service detects the largest face and compares it with each face detected in the target image. </p> </note> <p>You pass the input and target images either as base64-encoded image bytes or as a references to images in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the Amazon CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes is not supported. The image must be either a PNG or JPEG formatted file. </p> <p>In response, the operation returns an array of face matches ordered by similarity score in descending order. For each face match, the response provides a bounding box of the face, facial landmarks, pose details (pitch, role, and yaw), quality (brightness and sharpness), and confidence value (indicating the level of confidence that the bounding box contains a face). The response also provides a similarity score, which indicates how closely the faces match. </p> <note> <p>By default, only faces with a similarity score of greater than or equal to 80% are returned in the response. You can change this value by specifying the <code>SimilarityThreshold</code> parameter.</p> </note> <p> <code>CompareFaces</code> also returns an array of faces that don't match the source image. For each face, it returns a bounding box, confidence value, landmarks, pose details, and quality. The response also returns information about the face in the source image, including the bounding box of the face and confidence value.</p> <p>If the image doesn't contain Exif metadata, <code>CompareFaces</code> returns orientation information for the source and target images. Use these values to display the images with the correct image orientation.</p> <p>If no faces are detected in the source or target images, <code>CompareFaces</code> returns an <code>InvalidParameterException</code> error. </p> <note> <p> This is a stateless API operation. That is, data returned by this operation doesn't persist.</p> </note> <p>For an example, see <a>faces-compare-images</a>.</p> <p>This operation requires permissions to perform the <code>rekognition:CompareFaces</code> action.</p>

-- | <p>Detects faces within an image that is provided as input.</p> <p> <code>DetectFaces</code> detects the 100 largest faces in the image. For each face detected, the operation returns face details including a bounding box of the face, a confidence value (that the bounding box contains a face), and a fixed set of attributes such as facial landmarks (for example, coordinates of eye and mouth), gender, presence of beard, sunglasses, etc. </p> <p>The face-detection algorithm is most effective on frontal faces. For non-frontal or obscured faces, the algorithm may not detect the faces or might detect faces with lower confidence. </p> <p>You pass the input image either as base64-encoded image bytes or as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the Amazon CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes is not supported. The image must be either a PNG or JPEG formatted file. </p> <note> <p>This is a stateless API operation. That is, the operation does not persist any data.</p> </note> <p>For an example, see <a>procedure-detecting-faces-in-images</a>.</p> <p>This operation requires permissions to perform the <code>rekognition:DetectFaces</code> action. </p>

-- | <p>Detects instances of real-world entities within an image (JPEG or PNG) provided as input. This includes objects like flower, tree, and table; events like wedding, graduation, and birthday party; and concepts like landscape, evening, and nature. For an example, see <a>images-s3</a>.</p> <note> <p> <code>DetectLabels</code> does not support the detection of activities. However, activity detection is supported for label detection in videos. For more information, see .</p> </note> <p>You pass the input image as base64-encoded image bytes or as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the Amazon CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes is not supported. The image must be either a PNG or JPEG formatted file. </p> <p> For each object, scene, and concept the API returns one or more labels. Each label provides the object name, and the level of confidence that the image contains the object. For example, suppose the input image has a lighthouse, the sea, and a rock. The response will include all three labels, one for each object. </p> <p> <code>{Name: lighthouse, Confidence: 98.4629}</code> </p> <p> <code>{Name: rock,Confidence: 79.2097}</code> </p> <p> <code> {Name: sea,Confidence: 75.061}</code> </p> <p> In the preceding example, the operation returns one label for each of the three objects. The operation can also return multiple labels for the same object in the image. For example, if the input image shows a flower (for example, a tulip), the operation might return the following three labels. </p> <p> <code>{Name: flower,Confidence: 99.0562}</code> </p> <p> <code>{Name: plant,Confidence: 99.0562}</code> </p> <p> <code>{Name: tulip,Confidence: 99.0562}</code> </p> <p>In this example, the detection algorithm more precisely identifies the flower as a tulip.</p> <p>In response, the API returns an array of labels. In addition, the response also includes the orientation correction. Optionally, you can specify <code>MinConfidence</code> to control the confidence threshold for the labels returned. The default is 50%. You can also add the <code>MaxLabels</code> parameter to limit the number of labels returned. </p> <note> <p>If the object detected is a person, the operation doesn't provide the same facial details that the <a>DetectFaces</a> operation provides.</p> </note> <p>This is a stateless API operation. That is, the operation does not persist any data.</p> <p>This operation requires permissions to perform the <code>rekognition:DetectLabels</code> action. </p>

-- | <p>Detects explicit or suggestive adult content in a specified JPEG or PNG format image. Use <code>DetectModerationLabels</code> to moderate images depending on your requirements. For example, you might want to filter images that contain nudity, but not images containing suggestive content.</p> <p>To filter images, use the labels returned by <code>DetectModerationLabels</code> to determine which types of content are appropriate. For information about moderation labels, see <a>moderation</a>.</p> <p>You pass the input image either as base64-encoded image bytes or as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket.

-- | <p>Detects text in the input image and converts it into machine-readable text.</p> <p>Pass the input image as base64-encoded image bytes or as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, you must pass it as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. For the AWS CLI, passing image bytes is not supported. The image must be either a .png or .jpeg formatted file. </p> <p>The <code>DetectText</code> operation returns text in an array of elements, <code>TextDetections</code>. Each <code>TextDetection</code> element provides information about a single word or line of text that was detected in the image. </p> <p>A word is one or more ISO basic latin script characters that are not separated by spaces. <code>DetectText</code> can detect up to 50 words in an image.</p> <p>A line is a string of equally spaced words. A line isn't necessarily a complete sentence. For example, a driver's license number is detected as a line. A line ends when there is no aligned text after it. Also, a line ends when there is a large gap between words, relative to the length of the words. This means, depending on the gap between words, Amazon Rekognition may detect multiple lines in text aligned in the same direction. Periods don't represent the end of a line. If a sentence spans multiple lines, the <code>DetectText</code> operation returns multiple lines.</p> <p>To determine whether a <code>TextDetection</code> element is a line of text or a word, use the <code>TextDetection</code> object <code>Type</code> field. </p> <p>To be detected, text must be within +/- 30 degrees orientation of the horizontal axis.</p> <p>For more information, see <a>text-detection</a>.</p>
